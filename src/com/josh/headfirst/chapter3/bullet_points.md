## Chapter 3 bullet points

- Variables come in two flavours: primitive and reference.
- Variables must always be declared with a name and a type
- A primitive variable value is the bits representing the value (5, 'a', true, 3.1416, etc.)
- A reference variable value is the bits representing a way to get to an object on the heap.
- A reference variable is like a remote control. Using the dot operator (.) on a reference variable is like pressing a 
button on the remote control to access a method or instance variable.
- A reference variable as a value of `null` when it is not referencing any object
- An array is always an object, even if the array is declared to hold primitives. There is no such thing as a primitive
array, only an array that *holds* primitives.
