## Chapter 4 bullet points

- Classes define what an object knows and what an object does.
- Things an object knows are **instance variables**.
- Things an object does are its **methods** (behaviour).
- Methods can use instance variables so that objects of the same type can behave differently
- A method can have parameters, which means you can pass one or more values into the method.
- The number and type of values you pass in must match the order and type of the parameters declared by the method.
- Values passed in and out of methods can be implicitly promoted to a larger type of explicitly cast to a smaller type.
- The value you pass as an argument to a method can be a literal value (2, 'c', etc.) or a variable of the declared 
parameter type (for example, *x* where *x* is an int variable).
- A method *must* declare a return type. A void return means the method doesn't return anything
- If a method declares a non-void return type, it *must* return a value compatible with the declared return type.
