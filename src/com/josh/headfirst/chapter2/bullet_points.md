## Chapter 2 bullet points

- OOP lets you extend a program without having to touch previously tested, working code.
- All Java code is defined in a **class**
- A class describes how to make an object of that class type. **A class is like a blueprint**.
- An object can take care of itself; you don't have to know or care *how* the object does it.
- An object **knows** things and **does** things.
- Things an object knows about itself are called **instance variables**. They represent the *state* of an object.
- Things an object does are called **methods**. They represent the *behaviour* of an object.
- When you create a class, you may also want to create a separate test class which you'll use to create objects of your
new class type.
- A class can **inherit** from instance variables and methods from a more abstract **superclass**.
- At runtime, a Java program is nothing more than objects 'talking' to other objects.
